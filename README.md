lsmim
=====

little C program that imitates 'ls' / prints information about files and directories

Usage: 'lsmim [OPTION] [DIRECTORY]' or 'lsmim [DIRECTORY] [OPTION]'.
	OPTION = -s or -S for a simplified listing.

it is pretty verbose in its default state without -s being provided.

todo: fix time output to mimic ls's.
